# Point2Go

Point2Go is an iOS app that allows users to save and manage locations directly on a map.  
It supports adding pins with reverse-geocoded addresses, storing them in Core Data, and reloading them later.  
Users can re-center the map to their current location, delete individual pins, or remove all saved locations at once.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Show current user location on the map.
- Add pins by tapping anywhere on the map.
- Reverse geocoding: each pin shows its street and city.
- Save locations in Core Data for persistence.
- Re-load saved pins automatically when reopening the app.
- Delete individual pins or all pins with one tap.
- Re-center button to quickly move back to your position.
